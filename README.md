### Notes
It was confusing trying to understand and remember the hierarchy between the view controllers and the UI cells. I think with a little more practice I can get it down and it will become my second nature. This time, I challenged myself by letting myself mess around with the app to see what other implementations I can add along with trying to go to the next step without strictly following the guided videos.
